## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

## Making Changes

1. **Fork** the repository on GitHub
2. **Clone** your fork locally
3. **Create a branch** for your changes:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. **Make your changes** - write code, add tests, update docs
5. **Test your changes** - ensure all tests pass
6. **Commit** with clear messages
7. **Push** to your fork and **submit a Pull Request**

## Code Quality

We use several tools to maintain code quality:

- **Ruff** - Linting and formatting
- **Pytest** - Testing
- **Pre-commit** - Automated checks before commits

### Running Checks

```bash
# Run tests
uv run pytest -v

# Run tests with coverage
uv run pytest --cov=jsonstat_validator

# Run linter
uv run ruff check src/ tests/

# Run formatter
uv run ruff format src/ tests/

# Run pre-commit hooks manually
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Testing Guidelines

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting a PR
- Aim for good test coverage (we currently have 109 tests)
- Place tests in the appropriate file in `tests/` directory
